# c-tokenizer-and-recursive-descent-parser
This program consists of four class files: Givens.c Tokenizer.c Parser.c and Analyzer.c . Each class
file has a corresponding header file where all constants, method declarations, struct definitions, include
statements, and global variables will be placed. (Header files are named the same as their corresponding class
file but with a .h file extension rather than a .c file extension).
